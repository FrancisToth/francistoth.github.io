This blog got created some years ago but has never been really maintained (Mostly because of a lack of time). Nonetheless I recently decided to document what I work and learn about and to use this blog for that.<br/><br/>

I gave a very cool talk at the [Techno-Drink meetup](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjF4bjI2oDmAhXBMd8KHfV_CvsQFjAAegQIBhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meetup.com%2Ftechno-drinks%2F&usg=AOvVaw2ZyI2XV4-CYm0wTr-gzNcj) recently

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

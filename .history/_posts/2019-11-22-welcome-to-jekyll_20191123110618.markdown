This blog got created some years ago but has never been really maintained (Mostly because of a lack of time). Nonetheless I recently decided to document what I work and learn about and to use this blog for that.<br/><br/>

I gave a very cool talk about microservices at the [Techno-Drink meetup](https://www.meetup.com/techno-drinks/) recently, and really enjoyed my time. Thank you guys for hosting this event and allowing me to talk. Aside from that, I recently became one of [John De Goes patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jdegoes/posts), and attended a first training session about GADTs. The Spartan tier is 300$/month which may be considered as a significant price at first,

def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.

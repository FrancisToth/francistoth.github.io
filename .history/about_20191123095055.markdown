I am a software developer, convinced agilist, living in Montreal with 14 years experience developing web/mobile apps, and optimizing work processes. My current passion are learning new languages and contributing to build highly scalable applications. I am highly skilled in Object Oriented Programming, but am also quiet familiar with Reactive and Functional paradigm.

I also give presentations from time to time, play the guitar, love music, and like to try new beers.

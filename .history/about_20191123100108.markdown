  <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word;">I am a software developer, convinced agilist, living in Montreal with 10 years experience developing web/mobile apps, and optimizing work processes. My current passion are learning new languages and contributing to build highly scalable applications. I am highly skilled in Object Oriented Programming, but am also quiet familiar with Reactive and Functional paradigm.</p>
